  # Visual regression tests are available for local development (pnpm test:visual)
  # but skipped in CI due to cross-platform font rendering differences.
  # Baselines captured on macOS differ from Linux CI runners by 2-5% even with
  # maxDiffPixelRatio tolerance. Options for future:
  # - Use Docker for consistent snapshot generation
  # - Generate Linux-specific baselines in CI
  # - Use Chromatic or Percy for cloud visual testing
